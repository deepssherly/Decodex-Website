                                <p>Intergenerational shared sites are not a new concept in the United States. Messiah Lifeways, a residential community for older adults in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, opened more than 40 years ago with a childcare center
                                    and preschool on its campus. It’s still thriving today. For years, researchers have studied care programs for children and older adults that share the same building or campus, and foster relationships across generations.
                                    Although shared sites vary widely, the most common model pairs preschools with adult day care or nursing homes. A typical day at ONEgeneration in Van Nuys, California, for example, includes older adults doing watercolor
                                    art with toddlers, holding and feeding babies in the infant room, and teaching preschoolers Mandarin or Spanish.</p>

                                <p>Research shows that intergenerational shared sites increase the health and well-being of both young and older participants, reduce social isolation, and create cost efficiencies. They are joyful places. And unsurprisingly,
                                    the concept is a popular one; when asked, Americans are overwhelmingly in favor of shared sites. A recent Harris poll commissioned by Generations United and the Eisner Foundation found that nearly all Americans believe
                                    older adults and children have skills and talents to help one another, and that 85 percent would prefer a shared site that fosters intergenerational connection over an age-segregated facility if they or a loved one
                                    needed care. And yet, while successful shared sites exist in countries around the world—including Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Spain, and Singapore—there are fewer than 150 of them in the United States,
                                    compared to tens of thousands of age-segregated care facilities around the country. So, as one site director put it, “Why aren’t these in every community?” The answer is that this relatively simple care model, it turns
                                    out, is difficult to pull off, complicated by funding silos and cumbersome regulations. Most funders that support care facilities focus on either childcare or eldercare, forcing operators of shared sites to seek and
                                    manage separate funding sources. Furthermore, the staffing plans, emergency evacuation procedures, and other regulations that govern care sites for younger people differ from those designed for older populations.</p>

                                <h2>1. Increase Awareness of the Benefits of Shared Sites</h2>

                                <p>Only 26 percent of Americans are aware of places in their community that care for children and older adults together. Introducing more people to the concept and highlighting its benefits—for younger and older adults, and
                                    those in between—will lead more people to advocate for and invest in them. Simply making intergenerational connection more visible through the design of buildings, community engagement, and promotional materials is
                                    one way to do this. At the Grace Living Center and Jenks West Elementary intergenerational site in Jenks, Oklahoma, for example, pre-kindergarten and kindergarten classrooms are located within a skilled nursing facility—and
                                    visible from the lobby. Each morning, the “grands” welcome children as they walk to classes run and staffed by the school district. The site’s Reading Buddies program also engages older adults as tutors, and ice-cream
                                    socials and other informal activities encourage intergenerational mixing.</p>
                                <p>Another way to do this is by sharing data and stories about the positive effects on participants, which program directors and boards, advocates, and entrepreneurs can do via social media, community gatherings, campaigns,
                                    and pitches for project funding. For example, research shows that older adults in shared sites feel more accomplished, improve cognitively and physically, and find new purpose in their daily lives. Meanwhile, children
                                    thrive under the extra attention they receive, while learning essential skills like patience and tolerance. “I get calls from teachers after our kids graduate and go on to grade school,” said Keith Leiderman, CEO of
                                    the shared adult day care Kingsley House in New Orleans, Louisiana, “and they say our kids are the most compassionate, empathetic, and accepting children, who don’t think twice about being friends with kids with disabilities.”
                                    Shared sites benefit and build the health-care workforce as well. Geriatric Career Development Program at New Jewish Home, a long-term care facility in New York, operates a high-school program that has graduated nearly
                                    900 at-risk students. The program has not only sparked student interest in health-related careers but also helped them develop a range of useful life skills. One graduating senior said she learned “self-respect and
                                    how to respect our elders” from the program, along with the meaning of true friendship, self-improvement, and perseverance. Of the recent graduating class, 100 percent were college-bound.</p>

                                <h2>2. Engage Champions and Build Community Alliances </h2>
                                <p>Raising general awareness of the benefits of shared sites is important, but buy-in and support from local community members and elected officials are crucial to getting them built and maintaining their vibrancy over the
                                    longer term. A shared site that draws on the talents and resources of the local community, and that invites a range of groups to take part in its successes and tribulations will more likely prosper over the longer term.
                                    Engaged local champions are invaluable to progress. As one example, Pam Smith, an activist and a former school board member in San Diego County, California, advocated for building a senior housing site on the grounds
                                    of a charter school in a predominately Hispanic area. Over the course of a decade, she educated fellow board members about the value of intergenerational practices and, starting with smaller programs like intergenerational
                                    gardens, demonstrated the benefits. Today, the housing site, Seniors on Broadway, and the school have an intergenerational pathway connecting them; students visit the seniors to share in art and cooking projects, and
                                    older adults walk to tutor children and enjoy activities at the school. </p>
                                <h2>3. Find Ways to Share Resources, Including Funding </h2>
                                <p>Innovation and creativity are key to efficiently using space, staff, and services in areas like dining, housekeeping, marketing, and building maintenance. But sharing funding is often the bigger challenge. Childcare and
                                    eldercare programs typically rely on fundraising and grants to fulfill their mission. But, as we mentioned at the beginning, foundations normally prioritize services for either older adults or children, requiring staff
                                    at intergenerational sites to develop separate funding proposals, and manage separate tracking and reporting systems. There are, however, ways to make it work. When the chief executive of Grace Living Centers explored
                                    dedicating space for children at one of its facilities, for example, he partnered with the local school board. With school buildings at capacity, locating two kindergarten classes at Grace Living saved the district
                                    the expense of purchasing additional classroom space.

                                </p>
                                <h2>4. Encourage the Development of New Policies and Standards</h2>

                                <p>As we alluded to at the beginning, shared site operators often struggle to navigate age-segregated licensing and accreditation rules. Regulations designed to protect older adults and children differ, so operators must meet
                                    multiple sets of requirements across a range of operational details, including staff-to-participant ratios and numbers of meals served. Advocates must help accrediting bodies and policy makers understand the challenges
                                    they face, and work with them to develop new, intergenerational-friendly standards. At Benevilla, an adult day care and childcare center in Arizona, for example, the state licensing agency for childcare originally said
                                    children could only interact with the older adults in spaces outside the childcare center. So the site built a separate room specifically for young and older people to interact, and assigned it a different address so
                                    that the children could go on “field trips” to visit the older adults while still meeting regulations. Over time, as the surveyors became more familiar with the intergenerational aspects of Benevilla’s program and its
                                    benefits, they’ve worked with site leaders to make it possible for the children to visit the adult services center in small groups. Generations United, the national advocacy organization for intergenerational programs
                                    and policies, has meanwhile worked with policy champions on Capitol Hill to prioritize shared sites. The organization shared program examples from Congressional members’ home districts and stories illustrating the positive
                                    impact on their constituents in meetings with Capitol Hill representatives and staff, during press events, and through informational materials. As a result, programs serving both young and old, and shared site programs
                                    such as co-located childcare and long-term care facilities, are priorities in the unanimously reauthorized Older Americans Act. </p>
